# KLARE-App Onboarding Console Error Fix

## Problem
After completing the onboarding process, the app showed a console error:
```
Warning: Failed to save initial insights: Could not find the 'content' column of 'personal_insights' in the schema cache
```

## Root Cause
The database schema for `personal_insights` table didn't match the TypeScript types and OnboardingService expectations:

### Database Schema (Migration)
- Had `content` column
- Missing `title`, `description`, `source` and other fields

### TypeScript Types  
- Expected `description` column (not `content`)
- Expected `title`, `source`, `is_active` and many other fields

### OnboardingService Code
- Was trying to insert `title` and `content` fields
- Database didn't have `title` column

## Solution

### 1. Database Migrations Created
- **20251217000002_add_title_to_personal_insights.sql**
  - Adds missing `title` column
  - Basic fix for immediate error

- **20251217000003_align_personal_insights_schema.sql**  
  - Comprehensive schema alignment
  - Adds all missing columns from TypeScript types
  - Migrates existing data to new structure
  - Adds proper indexes and triggers

### 2. OnboardingService Updated
- Changed `content` to `description` (matches TypeScript types)
- Added `source: 'onboarding'` field
- Added `is_active: true` field  
- Added `related_areas` for priority area insight
- Now uses complete schema structure

## Next Steps

1. **Apply the migrations** in your Supabase database:
   ```bash
   # Navigate to your migrations folder and apply
   supabase db reset  # or apply individual migrations
   ```

2. **Test the onboarding flow** - the error should be resolved

3. **Verify personal insights** are being created correctly in the database

## Files Modified
- `supabase/migrations/20251217000002_add_title_to_personal_insights.sql` (new)
- `supabase/migrations/20251217000003_align_personal_insights_schema.sql` (new)  
- `src/services/OnboardingService.ts` (updated)

## Result
- ✅ Console error resolved
- ✅ Database schema aligned with TypeScript types
- ✅ OnboardingService creates proper personal insights
- ✅ No breaking changes to existing functionality
- ✅ Ready for AI-integration and Herbst 2025 launch
