# Security DEFINER Views Fix

## Problem
Supabase Database Linter identified 7 views with SECURITY DEFINER property:
- `translated_content_sections`
- `translated_exercise_steps` 
- `translated_journal_template_categories`
- `translated_journal_templates`
- `translated_module_contents`
- `translated_quiz_questions`
- `translated_life_wheel_areas`

## Why This is a Security Risk
SECURITY DEFINER views run with the permissions of the view creator (often superuser) rather than the current user. This can:
- Bypass Row Level Security (RLS) policies
- Grant unintended access to sensitive data
- Create privilege escalation vulnerabilities

## Solution
**Migration: `20250529000001_fix_security_definer_views.sql`**

1. **Drop all existing translated views**
2. **Recreate with `security_invoker = true`** - This ensures views run with current user permissions
3. **Maintain all existing functionality** - Same columns, same translation logic
4. **Re-grant SELECT permissions** to authenticated users
5. **Add documentation comments**

## Security Model After Fix
✅ **Views use invoker permissions** (current user)  
✅ **RLS policies on base tables still apply**  
✅ **Authenticated users can access content** (as intended)  
✅ **User-specific data remains protected** (life_wheel_areas)  

## Testing
Run `20250529000002_verify_security_fix.sql` to verify all views work correctly.

## App Impact
**No breaking changes expected** - Your app should continue working exactly the same way, but now more securely.
